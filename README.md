# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository is a collection of my implementations and explorations of **Data Structures** and **Algorithms**. The primary goal is to strengthen my understanding and problem-solving skills in computer science by implementing these concepts from scratch in **Python**.

## ðŸ›  Current Progress

### Completed
- **Linked List**
  - Implemented a singly linked list with operations like:
    - Append elements.
    - Remove elements by index.
    - Traverse and display elements.
  - Language Used: **Python**.

### In Progress
- Diving deeper into foundational data structures and algorithms.

## ðŸ“š Planned Topics
1. **Data Structures**
   - Stack
   - Queue
   - Hash Map
   - Binary Search Tree (BST)
   - Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)

2. **Algorithms**
   - Sorting Algorithms (Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.)
   - Searching Algorithms (Binary Search, BFS, DFS)
   - Recursion and Backtracking
   - Dynamic Programming

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
- Write clean, modular, and reusable code.
- Focus on algorithmic efficiency (time and space complexity).
- Solve real-world problems using data structures and algorithms.
- Transition from basic concepts to advanced topics like Graph Theory, Dynamic Programming, and more.

## ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?
Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for:
- Cracking technical interviews.
- Writing optimized code.
- Deepening core computer science knowledge.
